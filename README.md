Homework assignement for Advanced-CSS
Portfolio of work for Nate Irvin

At this point, the website is designed more as a placeholder to showcase future work.  It is currently linked to the pre-work and week one mini-project simply to show that the links are functional, but in reality those are not pieces I will showcase in the future.  The remaining blocks were left as placeholders. It is also important to note that this assignment was based on HTML and CSS only and therefore as we learn more in the realm of javascript, I will make modifications to the portfolio site to better showcase the full skill-set obtained throughout the course. 

Overview of work: 
* Created an HTML from the ground up and linked it to a CSS style sheet (also created from scratch)
* Utilized semantic HTML to create various sections/elements including: 
    * Nav-bar
    * Heading
    * Main (About, Portfolio, Contact)
    * Footer
* Utilized flex-box to create a responsive site along with media queries for specific sizing. 
* Applied a color palette with some flare 
* Used some creative leeway to deviate from the exact layout shown in the assets. This was an intentional design decision to test some additional skills and have a more unique solution to the assignment.
