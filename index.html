                <p>
                    As long as I can remember, I've always been into adventure. Seeaking out new challenges and activities that draw me out into the world. I've adopted more hobbies than I can count by never turning
                    down an opportunity to try something new. My main passions lie in powersports of all kinds, which give the thrill of adrenaline and often
                    combine the thrill with the natural beauty of the world, riding and flying into and over some amazing landscapes. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Of course, I'm not able to spend all of my time outside playing and find myself tackling various challenges through web design, video production and photo editing when inside. I received a B.S. in Electrical Engineering
                    from Purdue University and am building on some of those foundations with Web Development. Maybe not always a direct correlation, but
                    when it comes to problem-solving... I classify myself as an expert!
